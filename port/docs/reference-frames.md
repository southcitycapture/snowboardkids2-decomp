# Frame-exact reference frames

How to put a frame the port drew next to the frame the real game draws from the
same input, and subtract them. This is what the 2026-09-12 rendering audit used
and what settled every "is this colour right?" question in it.

The idea is simple: the port and mupen64plus both take a Mupen64 `.m64` movie,
so the same controller stream drives both. The port then dumps the frame it
presented at a named retrace and the emulator dumps the frame it presented at a
named VI count, and the two PNGs can be differenced pixel for pixel.

## The pieces

* `port/tools/mkm64.py` — compiles a text input script (the same syntax
  `--play` reads, `port/scripts/*.txt`) into a `.m64`. One `.m64` drives both
  sides, so a new reference can be written here rather than recorded on the G4.
* `port/tools/input_m64.c` — a ~60-line mupen64plus **input plugin** that hands
  out one `.m64` sample per controller read. `mupen64plus-ui-console` has no
  movie playback of its own; this is the whole of what it was missing. The
  movie is named by `$SBK_M64`.
* The port's `--play FILE` (replay), `--shotat R1,R2,...` (write the frame
  presented at each of those retraces to `/tmp/sbk-shot-<retrace>.ppm`) and
  `--dumptris` / `--dumpdlat R[:N]` (the per-triangle and display-list dumps for
  when the picture is wrong and you need to know why).

## Making a reference

1. **Write the script.** Plain text, one command per line; `wait N`,
   `press BTN N`, `hold BTN`, `release BTN`, `stick X Y [N]`. `N` counts
   *controller reads*, not VI frames — both games poll once per game loop, so a
   read is about two VI frames while the game keeps 30 fps.

       # /tmp/ref.txt
       wait 3300
       press START 3
       wait 120
       press A 3
       wait 300

2. **Compile it.**

       python3 port/tools/mkm64.py /tmp/ref.txt /tmp/ref.m64

3. **Build the input plugin** (once; it needs the mupen64plus headers, which
   come with the `mupen64plus` Homebrew formula):

       cc -O2 -fPIC -shared -I/opt/homebrew/include \
          -o /tmp/mupen64plus-input-m64.dylib port/tools/input_m64.c

4. **Run the emulator** at the VI counts you want.  Two traps, both of which
   cost the audit an hour:

   * `--input <path>` alone makes the core look for *every* plugin next to
     that path, finds no video plugin, and dies in `osd_init` inside
     `glPixelStorei` with nothing useful on stderr.  Pass `--plugindir` as
     well so the other three are still found where Homebrew put them.
   * mupen64plus stops emulating when it reaches the **last** `--testshots`
     entry, and does not capture it.  Put a sentinel frame past the ones you
     actually want.

       SBK_M64=/tmp/ref.m64 mupen64plus \
         --windowed --resolution 640x480 --nosaveoptions \
         --plugindir /opt/homebrew/lib/mupen64plus \
         --input /tmp/mupen64plus-input-m64.dylib \
         --testshots 2000,2400,99999 "ROMs/<game>.z64"

   The PNGs land in `~/Library/Application Support/Mupen64Plus/screenshot/`,
   numbered in the order they were taken.  The "Unable to open config file"
   line the first run prints is harmless.

5. **Run the port** on the G4 with the same movie and the matching retraces:

       g4 ssh 'cat > /tmp/ref.m64' < /tmp/ref.m64
       g4 run --windowed --nolauncher --nopad --nopak \
              --play /tmp/ref.m64 --shotat 1444,1730
       g4 pull /tmp/sbk-shot-001444.ppm /tmp/port-1444.ppm

6. **Subtract.** Both are 640x480 RGB:

       python3 -c "
       from PIL import Image
       a=Image.open('/tmp/port-1444.ppm').convert('RGB')
       b=Image.open('/tmp/emu-2000.png').convert('RGB')
       print(sum(a.getpixel((x,y))!=b.getpixel((x,y))
                 for y in range(480) for x in range(640)))"

## The one thing to know about the retrace numbers

**The two sides do not agree on the absolute frame count.** The port's boot does
not spend the DMA time the console does, so it arrives everywhere earlier: in
Snowboard Kids 2 the port reaches the title at retrace ~2460 where the emulator
needs ~3210, and the attract demo lines up at port 1444 / emulator 2000 (the
audit's other known pair is port 1560 / emulator 2160). So the workflow is:
shoot a spread on both sides, find the pair that shows the same moment, and use
*that* pair from then on. Once found, a pair is stable — the same two numbers
came back identically across rebuilds.

The input itself is frame-exact; only the clock the two sides count on differs.

## What it cannot do

`--autoplay` is not controller input. Autoplay flips `gRacePlayers[0].isCpu`,
which is game state, so a recorded autoplay race (`port/scripts/golden/*.m64`)
replays only in the port, with the same `--trial` flags it was recorded under.
For a race reference in the emulator the movie has to actually steer — or use
the attract demo, which needs no input at all and is where the audit took most
of its race-lighting references.

## Worked example: is the near rider black?

The 2026-09-12 audit left open "the near rider draws at RGB (1,1,1)..(7,6,8)
while the course is right". The attract demo settles it with no scripting at
all: port retrace 1444 and emulator VI 2000 are the same moment, Slash seen from
behind. The dark pixels in the rider's bounding box:

| | most common values |
|---|---|
| port | (5,5,5) (6,6,6) (2,2,2) (4,4,4) (10,10,10) |
| emulator | (5,5,5) (7,7,7) (6,6,6) (1,1,1) (8,8,8) |

Same histogram. The rider's hair and jacket really are that dark on hardware,
and the "black rider" was the four-light bug, already fixed.
